		about:
      '<p>Hello. My name is Roman. I have been professionally involved in web development since 2010.</p><p>I earned my first million at the age of 17, even before I switched to my current activity. True, this million was not euros or dollars, but Belarusian rubles, so it was not difficult to earn it. I was simply doing works on Delphi and C / C ++ for my classmates in college. This was during the period of receiving my first education, where I acquired the specialty of "technician-programmer".</p><p>After college, I got a job where I did not have to strain myself too much and I calmly got involved in the world of the web. In parallel with this, I received higher education.</p><p>Three years of sitting in an uncomfortable room and watching series got pretty boring for me and I quit. My side income was twice my salary, so I could afford to just go freelance.</p><p>Starting in 2010 with bare PHP, I gained a lot of experience with Joomla, Wordpress, MODx, Prestashop, Opencart and even 1C-Bitrix, and finally moved on to frameworks. Lately, I have been actively writing in Laravel, discovered Nuxt.js and Tailwind, but in the frontend I managed to work with all the popular things.</p>',
